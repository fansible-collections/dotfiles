# Ansible Collection - fansilet.dotfiles

This collection has a set of roles and ansible plugins to install and configure
multiple applications used for a development desktop.

It started by automating the installation of my `dotfiles` and evolved to a full
automated and customized way of keeping `dotfiles` organized and maintained as a
code.

Here you'll find settings and configurations to create or sync your dotfiles
across multiple machines.

Some tools are still being added to the collection, but here's a few list of what
is already supported: `vim`, `tmux`, `bash`, `gpg`, `gnome` and many more to come.  


This collection is maintained by [Fansilet
Collection](https://github.com/fansilet-collections), join us to add more cool
stuff in our ansible collections. :wink:
